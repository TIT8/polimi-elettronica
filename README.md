# Feature

- Webite hosting student notes of the Electronics Engineering course of [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en)
- Both [bachelor](https://www.polimi.it/corsi/corsi-di-laurea/1/2023-ing-ind-inf-1-livord-270-mi-357-ingegneria-elettronica) and [master](https://www.polimi.it/en/programmes/laurea-magistrale-equivalent-to-master-of-science/M/2022-ing-ind-inf-magord-270-mi-476-electronics-engineering-ingegneria-elettronica) of science
- Webite builded with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Bearblog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) theme
- Derived from [valerionew's repo](https://github.com/valerionew/triennale-elettronica-polimi)
- Love for electronics
- ***Hosting a [self made Golang API](https://github.com/TIT8/go-api) on [flyio](https://fly.io/) for emailing me (via Telegram bot). It compares with formspree on the master branch (easier, but more limited). Also the price of the two (for now free, but depend on the usage) will be compared.***
