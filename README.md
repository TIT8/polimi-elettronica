## Future developement (cool features to have)

- [Multilingual](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/) support.
- Maybe [Hugo-Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) is a better theme ?!
- Toogle dark and light mode (***added on toogle branch!! [Here](https://deploy-preview-13--polimi-electronics.netlify.app/) the preview deploy***).
- A readily accessible blog section intended for electronics students at Polimi (allowing everyone to share their experiences, thesis, and research, even those who are unfamiliar with creating a personal webpage) ??
